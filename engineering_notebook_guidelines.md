# Engineering Notebook Content Guidelines

This document outlines the basic rules for generating content for the VEX IQ 2025 Engineering Notebook.

## General Tone and Style:
- **Language:** All content must be in Chinese.
- **Target Audience:** Write in a tone suitable for a 5th-grade elementary school student. Keep language simple, engaging, and easy to understand.
- **Enthusiasm:** Convey excitement and curiosity about robotics and the competition.
- **Clarity:** Explain concepts clearly, avoiding overly technical jargon where possible. If technical terms are necessary, provide simple explanations.
- **Fun and Engaging:** The content should be enjoyable to read and capture the reader's attention.
- **Narrative:** Tell a story of your team's journey, discoveries, and challenges.

## Content Focus:
- **Rules Analysis:** Break down complex game rules into understandable parts. Ensure all explanations are in line with the official "references/game manual - MixAndMatch2.2.pdf".
- **Strategy Development:** Document thought processes behind strategic decisions and scoring calculations.
- **Robot Design:** Describe robot iterations, challenges, and solutions.
- **Teamwork:** Highlight collaboration, individual contributions, and lessons learned.
- **Visuals:** Encourage the use of diagrams, sketches, and photos to illustrate points.

## Specific Rule Examples:
- When explaining game modes, use analogies or simplified terms a 5th grader would grasp.
- When discussing scoring, use clear examples and emphasize key scoring elements like the "Beam".
- Document both successes and failures, and what was learned from them.
